                                      Agentic AI systems employ sophisticated machine learning algorithms to continuously assess risk across multiple dimensions including credit risk, operational risk, market risk, and compliance risk. These autonomous agents process vast amounts of structured and unstructured data in real-time, identifying patterns and anomalies that traditional rule-based systems often miss. The research demonstrates that agentic AI achieves 92% accuracy in risk prediction, compared to 68% for traditional systems, while processing data 300% faster.
